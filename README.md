14.3 - Apps that display user generated content must include a method for filtering objectionable material, a mechanism for users to flag offensive content, and the ability to block abusive users from the service

14.3 Details

Your app enables the display of user-generated content but does not have the required precautions in place.

Next Steps

It is necessary that you put all of the following precautions in place:

- Require that users agree to terms (EULA) and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content
- Use moderators to flag and remove inappropriate content and offensive users
- Users need a mechanism to flag objectionable content and report users generating this content
- Users need a mechanism to block abusive users
- Developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content
- Developer needs a method for ejecting users who violate the terms of the EULA
```

查了下目前的一些热门应用还真的都有举报的入口，比如足记，微信朋友圈，点击后提示举报成功之类。至于后台功能苹果也看不到，倒是无所谓。
